# UniversalConsistentTestforGraphsofGGM
This GitHub repository contains the R code used to perform the test statistic in the paper "Universally Consistent Tests for the Graph of a Gaussian Graphical Model". It includes the R code for demonstrating both the naive test and the enhanced modified test. Additionally, the repository provides code for a data-driven approach to selecting tuning parameters for the enhanced test, as well as the code used in the real data analysis.
